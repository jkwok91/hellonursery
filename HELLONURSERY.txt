MOVING
  Moved more stuff to work. The Phacelia seeds finally germinated and then immediately fried in the work greenhouse. Ugh!

SOWING
  Got a bunch of Tellima grandiflora seeds and put them in pots. We'll see what happens. I have extras if these are viable. Also I went on a hike with my dad and nate and got some seeds from Marin Headlands.
  Erysimum was collected before maturity and then allowed to dry on my countertop. Not sure if viable.
  Got new cuttings in as well

OTHER
  Slowly rebuilding up this growstation
