MOVING
  I moved the one successful Camassia leichtlinii 4" downstairs with its lupine. Also the Candytuft.

TRANSPLANTING
  Ripped out the remaining Ceanothus velutinus in the 1gal. Moved one of the Eriogonum fasc into one. I think I may have severed the rootball in a drastic way because not that many roots came with the plant........UGH. ok.
  Also moved the Sidalcea into a 1gal from the 4". And lastly I transplanted a Salvia sp? from a rose pot into that 4".

OTHER
  A radish has appeared in Veg 5gal. Actually it appeared when I transplanted it but I am unsure if it will survive.
  Also two cucumbers have appeared downstairs in one of the 4" and I probably need to transplant them at some point.
  My bare root stuff was not doing welllllllll. I'm down to 1 very dead looking Ceanothus velutinus in a 4".
