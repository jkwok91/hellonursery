TRANSPLANTING
  Upgraded one of the unknown Salvias to 1gal. Every Salvia downstairs needs to be upgraded but I don't have the soil for it.

MOVING
  Moved most of the vegetables to Trombetta. Ate some.

OTHER
  Some stuff died from being watered when it was hot!! probably got fungused roots. DON'T WATER STUFF WHEN IT IS HOT.
