MOVING
  The Salvia that had cucumbers in it has been moved to Trombetta. As has another Salvia leucophylla. Excited for those to do well???
  The roots were great. Just starting to circle around the bottom of their pots.

TRANSPLANTING
  Finally got more soil, upgraded a number of the most vigorous-looking Salvias into bigger pots. Downgraded the geranium back to 4", included candytuft which has really taken off since being moved downstairs.

OTHER
  It rained this past weekend, and yesterday, which was lovely. Everything is nice and watered.
  The Eriogonum fasc that I broke roots off is still alive but grrrr idk. i really hope it bounces back. Super sorry.
  Just broke some roots off the Epilobium cuz I wanted to move it out of the 4" where it was doing really poorly idfk it prolly will die.
