TRANSPLANTING
  Upgraded the tomatoes to bigger pots. It is getting warmer outside and they are growing nicely. Also finally upgraded the Ribes to a halfgallon thing.

SOWING
  Found some lupine seeds at Annadel that were ready. One has just emerged after less than a week of sowing. Also found some hellebore seeds at Mendo Bot, but I scattered them randomly and I don't know if they are actually gonna pop. Also they might need a cold snap. Whatever. They're in the soil somewhere.

MOVING
  Many plants have been moved to Trombetta! Hurray. They will survive because they are watered by automatic irrigation.

OTHER
  Seeds have died. Starting over.
