MOVING
  This past Saturday I brought a bunch of the vegetables to Santa Rosa and planted them in the backyard veg garden.

TRANSPLANTING
  I sadly had to kill the Wedding Cake plant as it was a male and I had no use for it. Instead I used that pot to grow out a Red Pride tomato and a kale.

SOWING
  I also put two sweet pea seeds in that pot.

OTHER
  The sweet pea in the Vegetable master pot looks good. The radishes look kinda shitty, and the kales look the same. I wonder what they want. Hm.
  I ate one of the kale seedlings in Santa Rosa and it was good not great.
  Anyway it is gonna rain tomorrow and later this week. Hopefully that helps everyone grow.
