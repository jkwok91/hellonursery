TRANSPLANTING
  Moved two russian kales to their own pots. Moved the Phylla nodiflora to less rocky medium. Moved one of the suffering Camas to the phylla nodiflora's old mix cuz it drains better.

MOVING
  Moved Phylla nodiflora downstairs to crate. Also brought that one Salvia leucophylla that was flowering down there.

OTHER
  GRS is somewhat recovering but still has some leaf tip necrosis. I hope it grows new leaves and sheds these.
  The Ceanothus velutinus look really really dead. Ugh.
