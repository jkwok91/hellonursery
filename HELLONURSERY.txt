TRANSPLANTING
  Upgraded some Salvias downstairs to 4" and 1 of them to 1gal. I'm out of 1gals. Need to grab the ones I left at Xo's house. Also I'm out of soil.
  Also upgraded the White Queen to Xo's orange pot.
  Moved bunch of shit to a 5gal cuz I have no other big pots. It's a natives pot.

SOWING
  I want more Tiny Tim tomatoes! Because they are small.
  Also sowed some Erigeron glaucus in the 6-pack where they all fucking died.

MOVING
  Moved the GRS tomato downstairs. It's sunny enough. And IDGAF if it dies. I have a lot of tomatoes.

OTHER
  Aphids are still in the Veg 5gal :( I have been pinching them to death.
  I am concerned that the weather may be too hot for snap peas now?!?!?!?!!? are they gonna be gros?S?S?S?S?S? then again i was harvesting that shit in summer in NY so maybe not.
