What did I do today (reflected in the above inventory):

MOVING
  I moved stuff down to the backyard where it is in a wooden crate and very protected from wind, but gets more sun exposure
  I moved some salvias out of the inside shelving area to the balcony
  I moved cannabis inside because it is very windy outside and I want to protect it

TRANSPLANTING
  I transplanted 2 Aquilegias from rose pots to 4"
  I transplanted 4 tomatoes from originalpot to rose pots

SOWING
  I sowed some Vate's Kale and some Tiny Tim Tomato

OTHER
  I checked on the stupid pea seed and it seems to have absorbed more water. No germination yet. Annoying.
  I also checked on my two persimmons but no action, so I put Vate's Kale in there.
  Two lupines have emerged, in the Eriophyllum and one of the C. quamash pots. I did not note them yet.
  Idk wtf is going on with this Phyla nodiflora. It is happier than it was previously because at least now it is putting out new growth. I maybe should repot it in real potting mix. It's currently in my bunk bonsai mix.

  It rained yesterday in the early morning. Just went downstairs to check on the plants. They seem fine. I applied a tiny bit of Superthrive.

  Rooted Cuttings
  - Mystery thing, from Alameda Seaplane Terminal, started 2-22-2022
    - 1 in rose pot
  - Salvia leucophylla, from Nate, started 2-5-2022
    - 1 in 4" pot

  Rooted Seedlings
  - Helleborus sp, from Marin Art and Garden Center, started ages ago and i don't even remmeber
    - 2 in rose pots
  - Lavandula 'Munstead', from Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, started? idk
    - 2 in rose pots
    - 1 in 4" pot

TRANSPLANTING
  I transplanted the unknown thing to its own rose pot.

OTHER
  The Camas in the downstairs crate are too wet. I have moved them back inside to monitor them.
  More radishes have appeared. One Vate's kale has started to appear.

  16:53: ok i moved a bunch of stuff around. moved one of the salvia leucophyllas to a 4" pot. i also repotted the two camas to check their roots and they are a little brown which is very worrisome. hopefully this new medium won't be as wet.

i also created a large tray of this spready thing that i anticipate will grow into a nice mat. i need the mat for greenroof experiment. this allowed me to put some succulents into that large pot outside.
oh and i transplanted hellebores from the big pot outside to their own rosepots.

i also transplanted the lavandula to diff medium cuz the sand seemed to not work!??? idfk.  anyway it's supposed to rain tonight/tomorrow
