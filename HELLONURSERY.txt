TRANSPLANTING
  Moved one of the GRS tomatoes from the 4" pot to its own pot. Dissolved one of the vate's kale seeds that did not pop in order to have medium for it. The roots looked fine enough. Potentially they are just cold outside? and that caused their leaves to curl up? Well now they are all inside.

OTHER
  Put in two Salvia cuttings I got from roaming around Fremont yesterday. Unknown species but it should be fairly common and easy to tell if they are able to grow up and flower. I'm just bad at IDing Salvias.
