TRANSPLANTING
  Moved two White Queen Tomatoes from the original pot to individual rose pots. Moved one of the Eriogonum nudum from Anza Trail to individual rose pot. This one has weird roots and i am not super confident butttt hopefully i won't move it for a while and it can really get rooty.

OTHER
  The GRS look better because i watered with very diluted MaxSea and SuperThrive, and because they are inside now and have been on the heating mat. The leaves have begun to unfurl. I feel bad that they were outside in the cold!
