TRANSPLANTING
  I transplanted the unknown thing to its own rose pot.

OTHER
  The Camas in the downstairs crate are too wet. I have moved them back inside to monitor them.
  More radishes have appeared. One Vate's kale has started to appear.

  16:53: ok i moved a bunch of stuff around. moved one of the salvia leucophyllas to a 4" pot. i also repotted the two camas to check their roots and they are a little brown which is very worrisome. hopefully this new medium won't be as wet.

i also created a large tray of this spready thing that i anticipate will grow into a nice mat. i need the mat for greenroof experiment. this allowed me to put some succulents into that large pot outside.
oh and i transplanted hellebores from the big pot outside to their own rosepots.

i also transplanted the lavandula to diff medium cuz the sand seemed to not work!??? idfk.  anyway it's supposed to rain tonight/tomorrow

SOWING
  Larner seeds came!!!!! so exciting. also the 6-packs came! i sowed 4 trays. will sow more later this week; tryna stagger the stuff cuz i am temporarily out of space / need to expand.
