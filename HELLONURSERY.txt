TRANSPLANTING
  Really need to upgrade some of those rosepot salvias downstairs. Too tired to do it today; will do tomorrow.

SOWING
  I harvested two leaves off the Vate's Kale today and it was great. Sowed 1 more.

MOVING
  Moved a kale and the GRS tomato inside. It gets nice and bright (and warm) in the kitchen in the summer so hopefully that helps.

OTHER
  APHIDS!!!! are present in the vegetable 5gal!!!! This is because I put the plants too close together. I have since thinned them out, by eating 2 russian kale. Russian kale is good but not good enough to keep so many around anyway. I need to inspect the big pea for aphids so it doesn't get out of hand. The big pea is very big now. There is nothing for it to climb on. I should ask Nate to bring me one of those unused tomato wire things from Tromb.
