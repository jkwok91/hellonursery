SOWING
  Scattered some Solidago seeds from Larner into the pot that has Borage seeds that I think are probably dead.

TRANSPLANTING
  Transplanted each of the Red Pride tomatoes to their own 4".
  Transplanted the radishes and 4 russian kales and the pea formerly in wtfbox into a large 5gal. Now known as the Vegetable 5gal. I wanted to know if they could help each other out and grow nicely. Plus I was getting nervous about the radishes all growing very closely together in these tiny rose pots. The Vegetable 5gal is now the final home for all of these things.
  Now I am worried I have stunted the pea's growth. It was growing like mad. Currently it is a little bit slumped over from transplanting.

MOVING
  Moved one of the Ceanothus velutinus which has shown no sign of breaking dormancy, to downstairs. Moved most of my indoor stock to the outside. Succulents have been put into the master succulent pot. I find that is the best place to grow them.

OTHER
  Seedling update: Phacelia is still alive. Erigeron are alive. No action in the Eriogonum or Salvia apiana pots.
  The GRS tomatoes continue to look kinda grimy. Still has leaf tip necrosis. No new growth. I am concerned.
