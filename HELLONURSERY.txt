TRANSPLANTING
  Moved Wedding Cake to the 2gal I picked up at South last week. Its roots were coming out of the halfgal I got it in, so it was a good time to transplant.
  The pea in the rose pot also was ready to be transplanted (nice roots coming out the bottom), so it was moved into the halfgal.
  Also moved Mystery thing to the 1gal that formerly housed one of the C. velutinus. Sadly that was just not breaking dormancy and its roots were not white at all so now it is chopped up and sent to decompose.

MOVING
  Moved one of the Sidalcea downstairs because it's doing well on its own (honestly I should've moved that one into the 1gal but I am stupid). Also moved the Great Camas that was on the balcony to the crate, as well as one of the C.v that has a vigorous Eriophyllum growing in it. And the Mystery thing, which is now in 1gal. Also sent to live downstairs.

OTHER
  Some stuff is starting to appear from seedlings, but I am so afraid that I will not note it here. Erigeron, Phacelia, maybe an Asclepias???? Very exciting but a very delicate time for them.
