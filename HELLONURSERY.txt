OTHER
  Bare root stuff (Camas, Ceanothus velutinus) continues to suffer. It rained this past weekend and some things are happy. I think some of the seeds from Larner are starting to germinate but I am skeptical of survival. Too tiny to tell.
  Added notes for some stuff I forgot to log before.
  Also last Friday I stopped at South on the way home and things were looking so pitiful that I took two of the last remaining Achillea home because I had grown those from seed and carefully separated the seedlings into rose pots and slowly all of those seedlings dried out and died because the god damn water is off at South.
