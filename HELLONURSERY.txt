MOVING
  Went downstairs to check on the stuff (I watered two days ago). Today's gonna be hot so I wanted to make sure I hit everything with adequate water. The checkerbloom was droopy so I brought it back upstairs to keep an eye on it.
  Everything else seems fine I guess? I feel like everything could be upgraded to a bigger pot. I don't have soil for it though. Also don't really have space for it.
